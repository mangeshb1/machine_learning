Tasks

1. divide data into training, test, validation 
2. get one set of features from a library 
3. create a generic script for svm, Naive Bayes, k nearest neighbor and gives a model 
4. create a generic script for which takes in  new example and gives probability for each genre
5. create a generic script for nn and gives a model 
6. create a generic script for nn which takes in  new example and gives probability for each genre
7. create a generic boosting script which gives combined probability 
8. create a demo script for predicting mp3 or a recording
9. create a generic script for a new model which takes in new example and gives probability for each genre
10. create a generic script for a new model and gives a model 
11. if time permits test different feature extraction models comapre each with svm and change model accordingly
